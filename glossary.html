    <h2>KMT</h2>
    <p>Particles: Are small objects that make up all matter. They are constantly moving, and there is always empty space between them. Energy makes them move.</p>
    <p>Kinetic Molecular Theory: The theory that particles make up all matter, always move, has empty space between each one, and that energy moves them.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>States of Matter</h2>
    <p>Gas: A state of matter that is past its boiling point, and has its molecules move around freely, they are spaced apart very well, and can be compressed.</p>
    <p>Liquid: A state of matter that is past its melting point but below its boiling point, has its molecules move around slightly, spaced apart, and cannot be compressed.</p>
    <p>Solid: A state of matter that is below its freezing point, has its molecules vibrating barely, tightly packed, and cannot be compressed.</p>
    <h2>Changes of States</h2>
    <p>Melting: When a solid reaches its melting point and turns into a liquid</p>
    <p>Melting point: The point where a material melts</p>
    <p>Freezing: When a liquid reaches its freezing point and turns into a solid</p>
    <p>Freezing point: The point where a material freezes</p>
    <p>Evaporation: When a liquid reaches a certain heat and evaporates into a solid. When it evaporates, only the surface becomes a gas</p>

    <p>Boiling: When a liquid reaches its boiling point and turns into a gas</p>
    <p>Boiling point: The point where a material boils and becomes a gas</p>
    <p>Condensation: When a gas goes below its boiling point and condenses into a liquid</p>
    <p>Deposition: When a gas goes below its deposition point and turns into a solid</p>
    <p>Deposition point: The point where a gas turns into a solid.</p>
    <p>Sublimation: When a solid goes above its sublimation point and turns into a gas.</p>
    <p>Sublimation point: The point when a solid becomes a gas.</p>
